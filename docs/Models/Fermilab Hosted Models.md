The lab hosts multiple Open Weight models on lab-owned infrastructure. These are split across two primary endpoints. Not all models are tuned for code generation, but those that are recommended for coding tasks will be listed in **Bold**. These models can be used in any of the [[IDEs and IDE Plugins]] that support _local_ models (Specifically, anything that supports "Ollama" or "OpenAI Compatible" endpoints.)

### **!!! You must be on the lab network (on-site or VPN) to access these models/endpoints. !!!**
