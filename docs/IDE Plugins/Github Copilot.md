In terms of an official stance on what it can be used with/on, Github Copilot is technically out for review with Cybersecurity. In practice, some folks at the lab are using Github Copilot with purely open source codebases. It's best to use caution and best judgment when it comes to using Github Copilot at the moment. 

It currently supports multiple models that are evolving and updating over time. These are primarily [[Cloud Models]]. If using these Github Copilot/these cloud models (even outside of Github Copilot), please exercise caution with what codebases you are using, assume that all information, code, prompts, and other data is being sent to Github/The model providers to further train and refine their models, and therefor is not appropriate to use with all codebases. 

### Access via Github Education

If you're a lab employee, you may get "Free" access to Github Copilot Pro via [Github Education](https://github.com/education) as an "Educator"/"Faculty Member". **!! WHEN APPLYING/VERIFYING YOU MUST COVER UP YOUR EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER ON YOUR BADGE !!** It may take up to 72 hours to get accepted/activate. Once activated, you must activate the Copilot Pro benefits via [this link](https://github.com/github-copilot/free_signup)

This will give you unlimited access to some models, and a certain amount of credits to use with "Premium" models. 

Github education does also come with some other benefits that are worth looking into, but aren't the focus of this documentation.
